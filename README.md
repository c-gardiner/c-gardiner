- 👋 Hi, I’m Chauncey!
- 👀 I’m definitely a bird person. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python. But i'm only making baby steps right now, because i don't find much time for programming a.t.m.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a musical project. So, if you're in Leipzig and you need a clarinet player, I'm your guy!
- 📫 How to reach me ... Well, I have to think about that first.
